# Todo-todo!

## An all in one to-do list, habit tracker and notes app!

### The initial to-do list functionality followed the curriculum of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). I added features like a habit tracker and a notes maintenance app on my own initiative.

## You can check out the project [here!](https://laldasji.github.io/todo-list/)



## Features

- **To-Do List**:
  - Keeps track of items with due dates and arranges them based on priority.
  - Tracks previously completed tasks, up to a total of 15 entries.
- **Habit Tracker**:
  - Monitors daily activities based on priority.
  - Resets daily and automatically saves habit history for the last 30 days.
- **Notes App**:
  - Allows users to create, store, and delete notes as needed.



**Note:** Currently, all information is stored using the user's local storage.
